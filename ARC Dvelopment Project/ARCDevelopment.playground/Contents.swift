//WeakReferences (important for tagging two or more references!!) - “With weak references, you can safely store a reference to another object without increasing its retain count. This prevents creating cycles with all of the required safety. ”

//Unowned References - “You can use unowned references when you can guarantee that the owner of another object will never exist when the reference is deallocated. Let's look at the following example:”


class CreditCard {
    let number: String
    let expiry: String
    unowned let owner: Person //the unowned removes the Person reference by deallocating it. Without (unowned), the creditCard and person would cause a memory leak, if there was no person.
    
    init(owner: Person, number: String) {
        self.owner = owner
        self.number = number//"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        self.expiry = "XX/YY"
    }
}

class Person {
    let name: String
    var cards: [CreditCard] = []
    
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

//Using the API

let me = Person(name: "Quinton Quaye")
let card = CreditCard(owner: me, number: "1234567890")
let otherCard = CreditCard(owner: me, number: "0987654321")
me.cards = [card, otherCard]

for card in me.cards{
    print(card.number)
}



//Leaking With Cycles - “One common way to leak objects and their memory is to create strong references between different instances, and cut off any external references.”


class MemoryLeak{
    //this init takes in a outside reference with the type of MemoryLeak
    var ref: MemoryLeak?
    init(ref: MemoryLeak){
        self.ref = ref
    }
    //this init sets reference of MemoryLeak
    init(){
        ref = self
    }
}

//A Simple Leak

func createLeak(){
    let leak = MemoryLeak()
}
